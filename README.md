# Pokedex

Welcome to the Pokedex project! This readme file will guide you on how to properly set up the project and provide important information about its dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: 

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokedex.git
```

2. Open the project folder and locate `Pokedex.xcworkspace`. It is important to **open the workspace** instead of the Xcode project file (`Pokedex.xcodeproj`) to ensure all dependencies are properly integrated.

3. Once you have opened the workspace, you can build and run the project in Xcode.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) library to connect to the PokeAPI and retrieve Pokemon data. The library has been included as a Swift Package Manager dependency, so you don't need to manually install it.

If you are encountering any issues related to Alamofire, please ensure that you have downloaded all necessary dependencies and that your internet connection is stable.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, you're more than welcome to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the project's coding style guidelines and that it is thoroughly tested.
